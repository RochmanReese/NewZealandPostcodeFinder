# NewZealandPostcodeFinder
Handy little Python3 script that finds New Zealand Place names as well as postcode locations and opens a webpage showing their locations.

IMPORTANT - READ THIS! Needs the file postcodes.csv to be placed in the same folder as this file to run. Can be modified to run Searches on any Country by changing the.csv file

Works in Python 3 - Does not work in Python 2

Runs from the command line Shows the Postcode for New Zealand Cities, Suburbs and Regional Place Names. Shows the approximate Latitude and longitude for a given Postcode or Location. Shows how many other Locations in New Zealand  also share the same Name and Postcode. Shows Postcode or Places location on a Map. Opens a webpage using OSMAND so needs an internet connection. Allow a few seconds to load each map. Works with either upper or lowercase letters however spelling or place names MUST be correct.

Installation instructions

Make sure you have Python3 installed - https://www.python.org/downloads/
Download both PostcodeFinder.py and postcodes.csv files. They must both be in same folder to run.
Running the Script

In Windows open a command terminal (type cmd into search bar. Drag the PostcodeFinder.py file into the command terminal which will open the terminal in the folder where PostcodeFinder.py is located. If you just click on the PostcodeFinder.Py it will still work, however the terminal will close immediately after the webpage opens which make multiple searches much more tedious.

In Linux, open a terminal in the same folder that the files are in then type python3 ./PostcodeFinder.py

Have fun!
